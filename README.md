# bruteforce_ai_detection
The primary objective is to design and train machine learning models for predicting brute-force attacks in IIoT networks. This involves:

1. Structuring raw network traffic into protocol-aware event logs.
2. Analyzing authentication behaviors and traffic patterns.
3. Developing predictive models to classify malicious vs. legitimate access.
